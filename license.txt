      from http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpc21isp/files/lpc21isp/
      LGPL 3
      I made a small change to lpcprog.c line 1643, marked by // wovo added
      The effect is that after programming the handshake line
      is toggled to cause a hard reset of the target chip.
      This is needed because soft start that 
      lpc21isp uses does not work for a Cortex.

      The bmptk-make.exe and bmptk-rm.exe are renames of the gnu 
      make.exe and rm.exe to make sure that these ones are used, 
      not any other rouge binary from another installation.
      (DevCpp for instance has an incompatible make executable)
